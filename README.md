# My-First-Loop-Machine


### I worked on this assignment and wrote everything from scratch!

I had no prior knowledge of this programming language and learned a lot from this project.

## I deployed the game on a server - Click Here

## Summary

I build this Loop Machine using visual studio code [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Live Server extension.

My tools of choice for building this project were: 

JavaScript, using [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html) and [Bootstrap](https://babeljs.io/en/setup#installation)

## Functionality
1. 9 pads squers with on and off states, which changes by mouse click/keyboard press and the square blinks in yellow.
2. Each square present a loop sample and named by the letters on the keyboard (Q W E A S D Z X C).
3. When a pad is turned on:
   - The recording starts automatically and displays the current recording list on the screen.
   - The machine starts playing it's loop on the next loop cycle and repeat the loop as long as the pad is on.
4. Buttons:
   - Play-session: plays the recorded session
   - Clear: clears the recorded list.
   - Play all & stop: controls of all active loops immediately.
5. The tempo of the music is determined by the BPM value (120 BPM TOP).
6. The volume can be changed by using the slide.
7. Switch between dark and light mode using toggle Switch.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
